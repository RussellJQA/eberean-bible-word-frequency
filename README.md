<p>
	This Web site provides information about how often each word occurs in the <a href="https://ebible.org/Scriptures/eng-kjv_readaloud.zip">(KJV) Bible</a>.
</p>
<p>
	For each chapter in the Bible, there is a separate, corresponding Web page.
</p>
<p>
	Each of those Web pages displays a sortable table with 5 columns of information for each word in that chapter:
	<ol>
		<li>Word: the word</li>
		<li>In chapter: The number of times that word occurs in that Bible chapter</li>
		<li>In KJV: The number of times that word occurs in the entire Bible</li>
		<li>Simple Freq: The simple, unweighted relative frequency of that word in this chapter, which is calculated as:
			<ul>
				<li>the total number of words in the Bible multiplied by the quotient of:</li>
				<li><ul>
					<li>In chapter (2nd column): The number of times that word occurs in that Bible chapter</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>divided by:</li>
				<li><ul>
					<li>In KJV (3rd column): The number of times that word occurs in the entire Bible</li>
				</ul></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Weighted Freq: The weighted relative frequency of that word in this chapter:
			<ul>
				<li>the sum of:</li>
				<li><ul>
					<li>the quotient of:</li>
					<li><ul><li>Simple Freq (4th column)</li></ul></li>
					<li>divided by:</li>
					<li><ul><li>the total number of words in the chapter</li></ul></li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>and [In chapter (2nd column) - 1]
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	Each page also links to a downloadable .csv file containing the same information.
